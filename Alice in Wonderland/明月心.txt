	独在异乡为异客: 相逢何必曾相识?
+	Alone in foreign land as foreign guest: Acquaintance why must each acquainted before?
	山里蔷薇开几度: 最忆论心知几人?
+	In mountain rose blossoms ever several times: Most reminiscence of heart known several who?

	流寓变光辉: 胡霜绕客衣.
+	Touring settlement transformed be glory: Foreign frost intertwined guests suit.
	寂寞凭谁暖? 飘扬何处归?
+	Lonely sole by whom warm? Floating aflutter where may return?
	.
	无语, 无绪: 慢曳罗裙归去.
+	No words, no thoughts: slow swaying magnificent dress there return.

	孤光泠泠独北望:
+	Lone light clean-clear alone North view:
	寂寂寒江明月心.
+	Lonely alone cold river Bright Moon heart.
