----

	裁剪冰绡, 轻叠数重: 冷淡燕脂匀注.
+	Fine-cut icy frills, lightly laid several fold: cold-faint rouge evenly filled.
	新样靓妆, 艳溢香融: 羞杀蕊珠宫女.
+	New-type fair-made, fancy spilt fragrance melt: fairyness slain Buds Pearl's palace ladies.
	易得凋零, 更多少: 无情风雨?
+	Easily wither fallen, more over how many: pitiless wind-rains?
	愁苦, 问院落凄凉: 几番春暮?
+	Mournful, question the yards lonely sorrowful: several times Spring dusk?

	凭寄离恨重重: 这双燕何曾, 会人言语?
+	Let sent leaving hatred overlaid: This twin-swallows whenever, understood the people's words?
	天遥地远, 万水千山: 知他故宫何处?
+	Sky far Earth away, myriads waters thousands mountains: know whose old Palaces be where?
	怎不思量: 除梦里, 有时曾去?
+	How would not consider: besides in dream, when had ever been?
	无据, 和梦也: 新来不做.
+	Seekless, the confused dream: newly come made not.
