= <Beauty Sorrowful> (<虞美人>) (CE 978-08-18) (by: 李 煜) =

	春花秋月何时了: 往事知多少?
+	Spring flowers Autumn moon when would end: Past affairs how many known?
	小楼昨夜又东风: 故国不堪回首月明中.
+	Little belvedere last night again east wind: Fallen State no more reviewable bright moon between.

	雕栏玉砌应犹在: 只是朱颜改.
+	Ornate colonnade jade-laid shall be still: merely the fairy faces have changed.
	问君能有几多愁? 恰似一江春水, 向东流.
+	Question whose Excellency of how much mourn? As if one river Spring water, eastward flows.
