= <Estimator: On Plum Blossom> (<卜算子: 咏梅>) (CE 1208) (by: 陆 游) =

	驿外断桥边: 寂寞开无主.
+	Post outer broken bridge aside: Lonely blossoming unowned.
	已是黄昏独自愁: 更着风和雨.
+	Yet already dusk alone in mourn: more over wind and rains.

	无意苦争春: 一任群芳妒.
+	No intention bragging for Spring: Boldly let various fragrant envy.
	零落成泥碾作尘: 只有香如故.
+	Fallen be mud wrecked into dust: only fragrance as old.
