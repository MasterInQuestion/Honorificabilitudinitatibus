= <Riverside Godly: Night Return Marshland> (<临江仙: 夜归 临皋>) (CE 1082-10) (by: 苏 轼) =

	夜饮 东坡 醒复醉: 归来仿佛三更.
+	Night drinking East-Hill sober again drunk: Return as if 3rd watch.
	家童鼻息已雷鸣.
+	Home valet nose-breath already thundering.
	敲门都不应: 倚杖听江声.
+	Knock door entirely no reply: Held staff hearing River sound.

	长恨此身非我有: 何时忘却营营?
+	Long hatred this body not me of: When may forget the mess?
	夜阑风静縠纹平.
+	Night serene wind still silky waves flattened.
	小舟从此逝: 江海寄余生.
+	Little boat ever since past: River Seas bearing rest life.
