= <River Snow> (<江雪>) (CE 808) (by: 柳 宗元) =

	千山鸟飞绝:
+	Thousands mountains birds flying exhausted:
	万径人踪灭.
+	Myriads lanes people's trace annihilated.
	孤舟蓑笠翁:
+	Lonely boat grass cloaked elder:
	独钓寒江雪.
+	Alone fishing cold River Snow.

[ Unknown Nameless (on <超级语文课>) @ ~ CE 2024-04:
	明月朔空静: 瑞雪覆流光.
+	Bright moon sole blank serenity: Auspicious snow over flowing light.
	独饮杯浊酒: 四望天地霜.
+	Alone drinking cup turbid wine: Around-view sky earth frosty. ]

	饮罢孤独酒: 拂袖出柴门.
+	Drink off lonely alone wine: Shake sleeves out poor gate.
	月光明如旧: 今人罕复斯.
+	Moonlight bright as still: Present people hardly again so.
