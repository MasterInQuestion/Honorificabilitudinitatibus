= <Prime Harvest 5th Nightly Tour> (<元丰五年夜游>) (CE 1082-08-20) (by: 苏 轼) =

	元丰五年 夜三更: 轼 与数友江上行.
+	Prime Harvest 5th year night 3rd watch: Shì and several friends river top touring.
	月映孤江孑独立: 饮酒赏月过三巡.
+	Moon over lonely river lonely stood still: Taking wine appreciating moon past 3rd round.

	大江东逝不曾竭: 明月圆缺万古悬.
+	Big river eastward never ever rested: Bright moon perfect imperfect everlasting hanging.
	江上风与山间月: 恒自无需人忧愁.
+	River-top breeze and mountain-between moon: Constant self need not people's worrying.
