----

	江南好, 风景旧曾谙:
+	River South fair, sceneries so well acquainted:
	日出江花红胜火. 春来江水绿如蓝.
+	Sun arose river flowers redder than fire. Spring arisen river water green as blue.
	能不忆江南?
+	How could not recall River South?

	江南忆, 最忆是 杭州:
+	River South recall, most reminiscent Háng-Province (杭州):
	山寺月中寻桂子. 郡亭枕上看潮头.
+	Mountain temple moon among seeking osmanthuses. County Pavilion pillow top viewing the surge.
	何日更重游?
+	When would tour again?

	江南忆, 其次忆 吴宫:
+	River South recall, next recalling Wú (吴) Palace:
	吴酒一杯春竹叶. 吴娃双舞醉芙蓉.
+	Wú (吴) wine one cup Spring Bamboo Leaves. Wú (吴) maiden twin dance drunken hibiscuses.
	早晚复相逢?
+	Sooner later shall reunion?
