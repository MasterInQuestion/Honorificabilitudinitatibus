= <Chǔ Words> (<楚辞>): <Fisher> (<渔父>) (~ BCE 304) (by: 屈 原) =

	屈 原 既放, 游于江潭, 行吟泽畔: 颜色憔悴, 形容枯槁.
+	Qū Yuán (屈 原) since exiled, touring at lakes, making poems by riverside: colors languid, appearance shriveled.
	渔父见而问之曰: [
+	Fisher saw and asked whom said:
	子非三闾大夫与? 何故至于斯?! ]
+	Are not your Excellency the 3 Branches Giant Officer? How did end up such way?!
<^>	屈 原 曰: [
+	Qū Yuán (屈 原) said:
	举世皆浊我独清. 众人皆醉我独醒.
+	Whole world deeply muddled I alone untainted. All people seriously drunk I alone sober.
	是以见放! ]
+	Thus exiled!
<^>	渔父曰: [
+	Fisher said:
	圣人不凝滞于物, 而能与世推移.
+	Enlightened do not stagnate over the material, but (thus) able to readapt and last with the world.
	世人皆浊, 何不淈其泥而扬其波?
+	Whole world deeply muddled, why not muddle whose mud and forward whose wash?
	众人皆醉, 何不哺其糟而啜其醨?
+	All people seriously drunk, why not taste whose dregs and test whose murk?
	何故深思高举, 自令放为? ]
+	Why thought profundity practiced high, self caused such exile?
<^>	屈 原 曰: [
+	Qū Yuán (屈 原) said:
	吾闻之: 新沐者必弹冠, 新浴者必振衣; 安能以身之察察, 受物之汶汶者乎?!
+	I heard that: newly hair-washed must shove the hat, newly body-bathed must shake the suit; how could with a body cleansed, bearing the items of indecency?!
	宁赴 湘 流, 葬于江鱼之腹中: 安能以皓皓之白, 而蒙世俗之尘埃乎?! ]
+	Rather toward Xiāng's (湘) flow, befallen river fishes' gut: how could with the shinning white, bearing the dust of vanity?!
<^>	渔父莞尔而笑, 鼓枻而去. 乃歌曰: [
+	Fisher lightly smiled, paddled oars leaving. And sang:
	沧浪 之水清兮: 可以濯吾缨.
+	Water of Cāng-Láng (沧浪) clear: may wash clean my ribbon.
	沧浪 之水浊兮: 可以濯吾足. ]
+	Water of Cāng-Láng (沧浪) murky: may wash clean my feet.
<.>	遂去不复与言.
+	Thus left saying no more.
