= <The Farewell Song> (<临终歌>) (CE 762-12) (by: 李 白) =

	大鹏飞兮振八裔! 中天摧兮力不济.
+	Giant Bird flying there stunning 8 fringes! Mid-sky broken which power supports not.
	余风激兮万世! 游 扶桑 兮挂左袂.
+	My remaining wind surges all generations! Touring Fusang there hanged left cloak.
	后人得之传此: 仲尼 亡兮谁为出涕?
+	The later attained which passing on: Zhòng-Ní (仲尼) perished there who would then pity?
