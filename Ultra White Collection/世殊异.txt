	君不见, 长安 宫阙今平地.
+	Your Excellencies don't see, Cháng-Ān (长安) Palaces quarters nowadays flat ground.
	又不见, 平地又起新高楼.
+	Again don't see, flat ground again rises new high belvederes.
	终不见, 卷土重来未可知?
+	Eventually don't see, rolling mud again comes may not tell?

	千秋基业何曾有?
+	Thousands Autumns' establishment when ever once?
	万岁大多短命鬼.
+	Long Lives so frequently are short-lived ghosts.


	王朝历代, 代兴代废: 谁得江山永固?
+	Dynasties iterations, iterations rise iterations fall: Whoever attained the Estate forever solid?
	昔时宫殿, 当年天子: 如今不知何处.
+	Old times Palaces, Once Heavenly One: Nowadays know not be where.

	皇图霸业终笑谈, 总是生民疾苦:
+	Imperial visions Supremacy eventually be laugh talking, always be living people's suffer:
	千古帝王多是贼.
+	Thousands years Emperors Kings mostly be bandits.
	民得安居乐业: 管他秦汉隋唐?
+	May people attain happiness in life: Whoever minds Qín, Hàn, Suí, Táng?
	怎奈兴, 百姓苦; 亡, 百姓苦.
+	However rise, the people's suffer; fall, the people's suffer.
