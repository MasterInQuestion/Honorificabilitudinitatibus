----

	六王毕, 四海一.
+	6 Kings done, 4 Seas united.
	蜀山 兀, 阿房 出:
+	Shǔ Mountain (蜀山) bared, The Building (阿房) built:
	覆压三百余里, 隔离天日.
+	Cloaked over 300 so Lǐ, separating Sky and Sun.

	骊山 北构而西折, 直走 咸阳:
+	Lí Mountain (骊山) northward built and westward turn, straight toward Xián-Yáng (咸阳):
	二川溶溶, 流入宫墙.
+	2 rivers flowing, melt into the Palace Wall.
	.
	五步一楼, 十步一阁:
+	5 steps 1 belvedere, 10 steps 1 house:
	廊腰缦回, 檐牙高啄: 各抱地势, 钩心斗角.
+	Corridors weaving intertwined, roof fringes high-reach: Each by their landscape, connecting hearts competing horns.
	.
	歌台暖响: 春光融融.
+	Singing stages warm sounds: Spring vibe charming.
	舞殿冷袖: 风雨凄凄.
+	Dancing sites cold sleeves: Wind rains chilling.
	一日之内, 一宫之间: 而气候不齐.
+	One day between, one palace within: but the weather uneven.

	嗟乎!
+	Sigh!
	一人之心, 千万人之心也.
+	The heart of one person, the heart of tens million people also.
	秦 爱纷奢, 人亦念其家.
+	Qín (秦) favors luxury, people also concern whose home.
	奈何取之尽锱铢, 用之如泥沙!
+	However taking which out of even the slightest, spent which as if sand mud!

	戍卒叫, 函谷 举: 楚人 一炬, 可怜焦土!
+	Duty soldiers shout, Cage Valley (函谷) revolts: Chǔ (楚) people one torch, pitifully all scorched!


	呜呼!
+	Woful!
	灭六国者六国也, 非{秦}也.
+	Had the 6 States perished the 6 States, not Qín (秦).
	族{秦}者{秦}也, 非天下也.
+	Had Qín (秦) eradicated exactly Qín (秦), not the world.

	嗟乎!
+	Pity!
	使六国各爱其人, 则足以拒 秦.
+	Were the 6 States each caring whose people, then shall be able to resist Qín (秦).
	使 秦 复爱六国之人, 则递三世可至万世而为君; 谁得而族灭也?
+	Were Qín (秦) to also care people of the 6 States, then toward the 3rd generation to all generations may be the Sovereign; who could possibly have which eradicated?

	秦人 不暇自哀, 而后人哀之.
+	Qín (秦) had no chance to mourn, but the later do.
	后人哀之而不鉴之, 亦使后人而复哀后人也.
+	The later mourning which without learning which, also causing the later then again mourning for the later.

	六世之余烈: 二世而崩徂.
+	6 generations' lasting heroic: 2 iterations and perished gone.

	齐 "湣", 秦 皇, 汉 "武", 隋 "炀":
+	"Fallen" of Qí, Emperor of Qín, "Martiality" of Hàn, "Scorched" of Suí:
	以天下为己之私产, 恣意妄为: 玩火自焚.
+	Taking the Estate as own property, recklessly wreak havoc: playing fire self burnt.
	.
	暴戾恣睢: 其势自毙.
+	Tyrannical whimsical: self tends to perish.

	民不聊生国废乱: 帝王功业空笑谈.
+	People hardly survivable State broken fallen: Emperors' Kings' accomplishment emptily laugh talking.
	文章大名传千古: 时宰时帝今几识?
+	Articles big names thousands years lasting: Contemporary Premiers contemporary Emperors now several reckon?
